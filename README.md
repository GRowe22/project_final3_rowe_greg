## Resources
* [Visually Hidden](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/src/css/main.css#L107-L169) I used boilerplate code to remove headings that created html structure, but were not visually necessary.
* [slimMenu](http://adnantopal.github.io/slimmenu/) Responsive menu with moible option for navigation.
* [Sticky](http://stickyjs.com) I used this to create the navigation element that sticks to the top of the screen when scrolling down.

## Deductions
* I reviewed the list of deductions for this project
and in the syllabus.

## Comments
* I had been working with a couple of options for the photos page (both jQuery and JavaScript), but everything I was trying has many, many atom errors.  I tried to fix them, but there were just too many.  Rather than risk the deductions, I went with the old tried and true...a little boring, but still satisfied the requirements.
